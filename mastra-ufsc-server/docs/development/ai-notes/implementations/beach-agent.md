- **Agent Layer**: Intelligent orchestration with local expertise

## Beach Data Structure

Each beach entry contains:

  name: string;              // Official beach name
  region: string;            // Geographic region (Norte, Sul, Leste, Oeste)
  description: string;       // Brief overview
  characteristics: {
    surfing: boolean;
    surfQuality: 'none' | 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'pro';
    waves: string;           // Wave description
    chilling: boolean;
    familyFriendly: boolean;
    infrastructure: 'basic' | 'moderate' | 'excellent';
    crowded: 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high';
    waterQuality: 'poor' | 'good' | 'excellent';
  };
  activities: string[];      // Available activities
  bestFor: string[];         // Ideal use cases
  access: string;            // How to get there
  highlights: string[];      // Notable features
}
```

## Tool Implementations
