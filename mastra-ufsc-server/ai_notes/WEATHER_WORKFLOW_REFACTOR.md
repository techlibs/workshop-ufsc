# Weather Workflow Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored the weather workflow to be more concise and educational by removing unnecessary boilerplate and focusing on core Mastra concepts.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Removed Excessive Logging**
- **Before**: Verbose logging with time tracking at every step
- **After**: Clean, minimal logging only for key events
- **Why**: Students can focus on workflow logic rather than debugging output

### 2. **Eliminated Manual Timeouts**
- **Before**: Custom Promise.race() timeout implementations
- **After**: Trust Mastra's built-in error handling
- **Why**: Less complex code, framework handles timeouts appropriately

### 3. **Simplified Error Handling**
- **Before**: Repetitive error logging with stack traces and durations
- **After**: Single error log with essential information
- **Why**: Cleaner code that demonstrates basic error handling patterns

### 4. **Extracted Activity Prompt**
- **Before**: 35-line prompt embedded in the workflow step
- **After**: Separate `createActivityPrompt` function
- **Why**: Better separation of concerns, easier to modify prompts

### 5. **Removed Configuration Noise**
- **Before**: Retry config and other options that may not be necessary
- **After**: Only essential configuration
- **Why**: Focus on core workflow pattern without distractions

## Educational Benefits

1. **Clear Workflow Pattern**: Shows how to chain steps with `.then()`
2. **Schema Validation**: Demonstrates Zod usage for type safety
3. **Tool Integration**: Clean example of using tools in workflows
4. **Agent Integration**: Shows proper agent usage without recursion
5. **Readable Code**: Each function has a single, clear purpose

## Code Structure

```
1. Imports and Schema Definition
2. Step 1: Fetch Weather (tool usage)
3. Prompt Template (separated concern)
4. Step 2: Plan Activities (agent usage)
5. Workflow Definition and Export
```

This structure makes it easy for students to understand the flow and modify each component independently.
