# Inventory Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete inventory management agent using Mastra AI with all requested features.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Data Structure (`inventory-data.ts`)
- Created Product interface with all required fields
- Mock inventory with 20+ products across 4 categories:
  - Groceries (rice, pasta, oil, flour, sugar)
  - Food (sandwiches, pizza, salads, sushi)
  - Drinks (juice, water, tea, coffee, soda)
  - Fruits (apples, bananas, oranges, strawberries, etc.)
- Helper functions for searching and filtering

### 2. Cart Management (`cart-manager.ts`)
- Thread-based cart isolation (each conversation has its own cart)
- In-memory storage using Map data structure
- Features:
  - Add items with quantity validation
  - Remove items (partial or complete)
  - Automatic total calculation
  - Cart summary formatting
  - Stock validation

### 3. Tools
- **search-inventory-tool.ts**: Search by query and/or category
- **add-to-cart-tool.ts**: Add products with quantity, includes thread ID
- **remove-from-cart-tool.ts**: Remove items or reduce quantities
- **view-cart-tool.ts**: Display cart contents with formatted summary

### 4. Inventory Agent (`inventory-agent.ts`)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model
- Memory persistence with LibSQL
- Dynamic instructions that include thread ID for tools
- Custom output processor that appends cart summary to every response
- Natural language interface for shopping interactions

### 5. Integration
- Updated Mastra configuration to register the inventory agent
- Created test script demonstrating all features
- Comprehensive README with usage instructions

## Key Features Achieved
✅ Browse inventory by category or search
✅ Add/remove items from cart
✅ Persistent cart state per conversation thread
✅ Updated cart summary with every response
✅ Memory for conversation history
✅ Natural language interaction
✅ Stock validation
✅ Price calculations

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Thread-based Cart Isolation**: Each conversation thread has its own cart
2. **In-memory Storage**: Quick implementation, can be replaced with persistent storage
3. **Output Processor**: Ensures cart summary is always visible
4. **Runtime Context**: Used to pass thread ID to agent instructions
5. **Tool Design**: Each tool has single responsibility with clear schemas

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script that demonstrates:
- Product search
- Adding items to cart
- Viewing different categories
- Removing items
- Final cart display

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Persist cart data to database
2. Add checkout functionality
3. Implement user authentication
4. Add product recommendations
5. Support for discounts/coupons
6. Order history tracking
