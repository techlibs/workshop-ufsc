# Agents.md Guide Creation

## Objective
Created a comprehensive, AI-oriented guide for building Mastra agents that serves as a concise wrapper for the detailed mastra.md documentation.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Structure
- Followed the src/mastra/ directory structure
- Organized content from simple (tools) to complex (agents)
- Provided clear progression: Tools → Workflows → Agents → Configuration

### 2. AI-Oriented Focus
- Emphasized LLM instruction best practices
- Included tool description guidelines for better LLM understanding
- Added workflow patterns for common AI scenarios
- Provided explicit tool/workflow selection rules in agent instructions

### 3. Practical Examples
- Used the existing weather agent as a reference
- Showed real code patterns from the project
- Included both basic and advanced patterns

### 4. Documentation Linking
- Created quick reference section with direct links to mastra.md sections
- Used line number references for precise navigation
- Maintained connection to comprehensive documentation

## Content Highlights

### Core Concepts
1. **Agents**: AI assistants with LLM, tools, workflows, and memory
2. **Tools**: Discrete functions with Zod schemas for validation
3. **Workflows**: Multi-step orchestrations with control flow

### Best Practices Included
- Clear tool descriptions for LLM comprehension
- Structured agent instructions with selection rules
- Error handling patterns
- Memory management strategies
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### Advanced Patterns
- Tool composition
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Retry mechanisms
- Utility function sharing

## Implementation Notes

The guide follows these principles:
1. **Conciseness**: Each section is focused and practical
2. **Intelligence**: Provides reasoning behind patterns
3. **Connectivity**: Links to detailed documentation when needed
4. **Practicality**: Uses real project examples

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Performance optimization tips
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Advanced memory strategies
- Production deployment guidelines
