- [x] `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Quick overview
- [x] `WEATHER_INTEGRATION.md` - Technical deep dive
- [x] `INTEGRATION_DIAGRAM.md` - Visual architecture

- [x] `test-weather-integration.ts` - Integration test

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Basic Functionality Test
```bash
npx tsx test-weather-integration.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
- Test 1 shows simple weather response (tool)
- Test 2 shows formatted activity plan (workflow)

**Status:** [ ] Passed / [ ] Failed

---

### Step 2: Run All Examples
```bash
npx tsx examples/api-usage-example.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
- 7 examples run successfully
- Different response formats shown
- No errors thrown

**Status:** [ ] Passed / [ ] Failed

---

### Step 3: Quick Weather Query
```bash
npx tsx -e "
import { mastra } from './src/mastra';
const agent = mastra.getAgent('weatherAgent');
const response = await agent.generate([{ role: 'user', content: 'Weather in London?' }]);
console.log(response.text);
"
```

**Expected:**
- Fast response (~1-2 seconds)
- Contains temperature, conditions, humidity
- Uses weatherTool

**Status:** [ ] Passed / [ ] Failed

---

### Step 4: Activity Planning Query
```bash
npx tsx -e "
import { mastra } from './src/mastra';
const agent = mastra.getAgent('weatherAgent');
const response = await agent.generate([{ role: 'user', content: 'Plan activities for Paris' }]);
console.log(response.text);
"
```

**Expected:**
- Longer response (~5-10 seconds)
- Contains emojis (📅, 🌡️, 🌅, etc.)
- Structured format
- Uses weatherWorkflow

**Status:** [ ] Passed / [ ] Failed

---

### Step 5: Streaming Test
```typescript
const stream = await agent.stream([
  { role: 'user', content: 'Activities for Tokyo?' }
]);

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

**Expected:**
- Response streams in real-time
- Complete formatted output
- No errors

**Status:** [ ] Passed / [ ] Failed

---

### Step 6: Memory Test
```typescript
// First query
await agent.generate("Weather in Barcelona?", {
  memory: { resource: 'test_user', thread: { id: 'test_thread' } }
});

// Follow-up (should remember Barcelona)
await agent.generate("Suggest activities there", {
  memory: { resource: 'test_user', thread: { id: 'test_thread' } }
});
```

**Expected:**
- Second query knows "there" = Barcelona
- Agent maintains context
- Memory persists between calls

**Status:** [ ] Passed / [ ] Failed

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

### Agent Configuration
- [x] Agent imports `weatherWorkflow`
- [x] Agent has `tools: { weatherTool }`
- [x] Agent has `workflows: { weatherWorkflow }`
- [x] Instructions mention when to use each

### Workflow Registration
- [x] `weatherWorkflow` is in `mastra` instance
- [x] `weatherAgent` is in `mastra` instance
- [x] Both are exported correctly

### Code Quality
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] TypeScript types correct
- [x] Imports resolve correctly
- [x] No circular dependency issues

## 📊 Response Format Checks

### Tool Response Should Contain:
- [ ] Temperature value
- [ ] "Feels like" value
- [ ] Humidity percentage
- [ ] Wind speed
- [ ] Weather condition
- [ ] Location name

### Workflow Response Should Contain:
- [ ] Date header with 📅
- [ ] Weather summary with 🌡️
- [ ] Morning activities with 🌅
- [ ] Afternoon activities with 🌞
- [ ] Indoor alternatives with 🏠
- [ ] Special considerations with ⚠️
- [ ] Specific timing suggestions
- [ ] Weather-aware notes

## 🎯 Integration Patterns Verified

### Pattern 1: Smart Routing
- [ ] Simple queries use weatherTool
- [ ] Planning queries use weatherWorkflow
- [ ] Agent decides automatically
- [ ] No manual routing needed

### Pattern 2: Composition
- [ ] Workflow uses agent in planActivities step
- [ ] Agent uses workflow when appropriate
- [ ] No circular dependency errors
- [ ] Both can be used independently

### Pattern 3: Flexibility
- [ ] Can use agent directly
- [ ] Can use workflow directly
- [ ] Can use tool directly
- [ ] All combinations work

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Performance
- [ ] Tool response < 3 seconds
- [ ] Workflow response < 15 seconds
- [ ] Streaming works correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid city names handled
- [ ] API failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Timeout handling works
- [ ] Error messages are helpful

### Type Safety
- [ ] All inputs typed
- [ ] All outputs typed
- [ ] No `any` types used
- [ ] Zod schemas defined

### Documentation
- [ ] README complete
- [ ] Examples working
- [ ] Comments clear
- [ ] Architecture documented
